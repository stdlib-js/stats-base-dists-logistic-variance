    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
variance = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic-variance@v0.1.0-umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var variance = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/stats-base-dists-logistic-variance/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-logistic-variance@v0.1.0-umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.variance;
})();
</script>
```

#### variance( mu, s )

Returns the [variance][variance] for a [logistic][logistic-distribution] distribution with location parameter `mu` and scale parameter `s`.

```javascript
var y = variance( 2.0, 1.0 );
// returns ~3.29

y = variance( 0.0, 1.0 );
// returns ~3.29

y = variance( -1.0, 4.0 );
// returns ~52.638
```

If provided `NaN` as any argument, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var y = variance( NaN, 1.0 );
// returns NaN

y = variance( 0.0, NaN );
// returns NaN
```

If provided `s <= 0`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var y = variance( 0.0, 0.0 );
// returns NaN

y = variance( 0.0, -1.0 );
// returns NaN
```
